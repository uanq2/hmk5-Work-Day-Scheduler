I used the given stater code to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This application can be run in any browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Moment.js library is used to show current real date and time.

This is where my repo resides https://github.com/uanq2/hmk5-Work-Day-Scheduler.git

This is the live application functioning https://uanq2.github.io/hmk5-Work-Day-Scheduler/
